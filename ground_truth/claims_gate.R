# green_etal_2016/ground_truth/claims_gate.R
# Output: printed gate summary; halts the run on any coverage or agreement failure
# Depends on: ground_truth/published_claims.csv, ground_truth/green_etal_2016_ground_truth.csv,
#   maintained/in_text_claims.R, maintained/output/
# Description: The coverage gate. It runs maintained/in_text_claims.R as a program rather
#   than reading it as text, because a block that errors at runtime, or that ends in a bare
#   expression and so prints nothing, satisfies any check that merely looks for its claim id
#   in the file. It then asserts that the number of printed claims equals the number of
#   extraction rows requiring one, that the two id sets are equal in both directions, and
#   that every printed value agrees with the ground truth's value_rewrite at the precision
#   the published page uses.
